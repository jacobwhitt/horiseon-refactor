# horiseon-refactor

## Horiseon Refactor Overview

This assignment was a refactoring of code within the files index.html and style.css. 
The main actions taken were to restructure some of the items within each file to make the layout of the webpage the same, but have the code more efficiently structured. 
The steps taken in that process were as follows:
1. Changing the header format to include the name "Horiseon" as the main header. 
2. Changing each div to a secion element in the html file. 
3. Consolidating the class elements in the CSS to fit into more structured pieces instead of each having its own seperate line of code for each element. 
This includes each benefit class, with h3's and img's being consolidated into a single piece. It also includes search engine optimization imgages and h2's.
